# MERN Stack Boiler Plate Script

This script is designed to establish a basic boiler plate for a 
full-stack MERN application. I discovered I was repeating myself a lot everytime
I began working on a new project. Now, I can automate a great deal of repetitive 
tasks. 

This script can also be(and should be) customized for your specific
needs. Dependencies and Structure are designed to be helpful to my 
personal workflow. This is not to be considered the end all be all
for your application. This is just a jumping off point.

Also, this boiler plate assumes you intend to deploy to heroku. If 
deploying elsewhere, some pre-written code may need changed. Please 
review the requirements of your deployment environment. 

Happy Coding! -Wides
