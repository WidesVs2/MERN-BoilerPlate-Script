# MERN Stack Boiler Plate Script

This script is designed to establish a basic boiler plate for a 
full-stack MERN application. I discovered I was repeating myself a lot everytime
I began working on a new project. Now, I can automate a great deal of repetitive 
tasks. 

This script can also be(and should be) customized for your specific
needs. Dependencies and Structure are designed to be helpful to my 
personal workflow. This is not to be considered the end all be all
for your application. This is just a jumping off point.

Also, this boiler plate assumes you intend to deploy to heroku. If 
deploying elsewhere, some pre-written code may need changed. Please 
review the requirements of your deployment environment. 

Happy Coding! -Wides

# How to Run Script

This script can be ran as any other powershell script you use. However,
I've found for best results and ease of use, there is a recommended
method. This method requires Visual Studio Code, however it may be
possible in other editors such as Atom or Sublime, but I haven't tested
this.

# Step 1-Install Powershell Extension on VSCode

Open VS Code, click on the extensions sidebar, then search for 'powershell'. An
extension will become available to enable writing and running powershell scripts
with VS Code. Install this extension.

# Step 2-Move This Script File to Empty Directory

Place a copy of this script file into an empty directory you wish to 
use for your project.

# Step 3-Open this directory with VS Code

Use VS Code to open the directory with the sript file. This can be done
either through the terminal or file explorer. 

If using a terminal: 
     
     Ensure current working directory is where you wish to create your project
     and script file is present.

     Type the command 'code .' with no quotes and press enter.

     This command opens VS Code

If using file explorer:

    Right click in empty directory.

    Select option to open with VS Code.

    If this option isn't available, check documentation of VS 
    Code for how to enable this.

# Step 4-Use VS Code to run script

With the powershell extension in VS Code, when opening a .ps1 file, 
additional features and options are available. Specifically, in the
upper right corner is a button to run the current script. Slect this
and watch the magic.

This completes running this script with VS Code. My machine and 
internet connection averaged a 6 minute time window for this script. Your
results may vary.
